## About

This project contains my personal solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems
implemented in Clojure. The wonderful people that run Project Euler discourage sharing solutions,
so please only view the solutions to problems that you've solved yourself!

## Usage

The functions in this project are meant to be invoked through a REPL. Each problem file has
a `solve` function that computes the answer. Be warned that my solutions may be very
inefficient and slow.

## Unlicense

This project is released into the public domain under the terms of [The Unlicense](UNLICENSE).
